Rabbit
Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small
mammals in the family Leporidae (which also contains the hares) of
the order Lagomorpha (which also contains the pikas). Oryctolagus
cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants,
the world's 305 breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13
wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail. The
European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent
except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey
animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. With its
widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit is, in many
areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a
companion, and a source of artistic inspiration.

Temporal range: Late Eocene–
Holocene,

Although once considered rodents, lagomorphs like rabbits have
been discovered to have diverged separately and earlier than their
rodent cousins and have a number of traits rodents lack, like two
extra incisors.

Terminology and etymology
Male rabbits are called bucks; females are called does. An older term for an adult rabbit used until the 18th
century is coney (derived ultimately from the Latin cuniculus), while rabbit once referred only to the young
animals.[2] Another term for a young rabbit is bunny, though this term is often applied informally
(particularly by children) to rabbits generally, especially domestic ones. More recently, the term kit or kitten
has been used to refer to a young rabbit.
A group of rabbits is known as a colony or nest (or, occasionally, a warren, though this more commonly
refers to where the rabbits live).[3] A group of baby rabbits produced from a single mating is referred to as a
litter[4] and a group of domestic rabbits living together is sometimes called a herd.[5]
The word rabbit itself derives from the Middle English rabet, a borrowing from the Walloon robète, which
was a diminutive of the French or Middle Dutch robbe.[6]

Taxonomy
Rabbits and hares were formerly classified in the order Rodentia (rodent) until 1912, when they were moved
into a new order, Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas). Below are some of the genera and species of the
rabbit.

Differences from hares
The term "rabbit" is typically used for all Leporidae species excluding the genus Lepus. Members of that
genus are instead known as hares or jackrabbits.
Lepus species are typically precocial, born relatively mature and mobile with hair and good vision, while
other rabbit species are altricial, born hairless and blind, and requiring closer care. Hares live a relatively
solitary life in a simple nest above the ground, while most other rabbits live in social groups in burrows or
warrens. Hares are generally larger than other rabbits, with ears that are more elongated, and with hind legs
that are larger and longer. Descendants of the European rabbit are commonly bred as livestock and kept as
pets, whereas no hares have been domesticated - the breed called the Belgian hare is a domestic rabbit which
has been selectively bred to resemble a hare.

Domestication

Rabbit - Wikipedia

Rabbits have long been domesticated.
Beginning in the Middle Ages, the
European rabbit has been widely kept
as livestock, starting in ancient Rome.
Selective breeding has generated a wide
variety of rabbit breeds, of which many
(since the early 19th century) are also
kept as pets. Some strains of rabbit
have been bred specifically as research
subjects.
As livestock, rabbits are bred for their
meat and fur. The earliest breeds were
important sources of meat, and so
became larger than wild rabbits, but

in size from dwarf to giant. Rabbit fur,

breed, for example, was developed for
its long, silky fur, which is often handspun into yarn. Other domestic rabbit breeds have been developed primarily for the commercial fur trade,
including the Rex, which has a short plush coat.

Biology
Evolution
Because the rabbit's epiglottis is engaged over the soft
palate except when swallowing, the rabbit is an obligate
nasal breather. Rabbits have two sets of incisor teeth,
one behind the other. This way they can be distinguished
from rodents, with which they are often confused.[7] Carl
Linnaeus originally grouped rabbits and rodents under
the class Glires; later, they were separated as the
scientific consensus is that many of their similarities
were a result of convergent evolution. However, recent
DNA analysis and the discovery of a common ancestor
has supported the view that they do share a common
lineage, and thus rabbits and rodents are now often
referred to together as members of the superorder Glires.[8]

Morphology
Since speed and agility are a rabbit's main defenses against predators (including the swift fox), rabbits have
large hind leg bones and well developed musculature. Though plantigrade at rest, rabbits are on their toes
while running, assuming a more digitigrade posture. Rabbits use their strong claws for digging and (along
with their teeth) for defense.[9] Each front foot has four toes plus a dewclaw. Each hind foot has four toes
(but no dewclaw).[10]

Most wild rabbits (especially compared to
hares) have relatively full, egg-shaped
bodies. The soft coat of the wild rabbit is
agouti in coloration (or, rarely, melanistic),
which aids in camouflage. The tail of the
rabbit (with the exception of the cottontail
species) is dark on top and white below.
Cottontails have white on the top of their
tails.[11]

Skeleton of the rabbit

As a result of the position of the eyes in its
skull, the rabbit has a field of vision that
encompasses nearly 360 degrees, with just
a small blind spot at the bridge of the
nose.[12]

Hind limb elements
The anatomy of rabbits' hind limbs are structurally similar to that of
other land mammals and contribute to their specialized form of
locomotion. The bones of the hind limbs consist of long bones (the
femur, tibia, fibula, and phalanges) as well as short bones (the
tarsals). These bones are created through endochondral ossification
during development. Like most land mammals, the round head of the
femur articulates with the acetabulum of the os coxae. The femur
articulates with the tibia, but not the fibula, which is fused to the
tibia. The tibia and fibula articulate with the tarsals of the pes,

are able to move considerably faster.[13] Rabbits stay just on their
toes when moving; this is called Digitigrade locomotion. The hind
feet have four long toes that allow for this and are webbed to prevent them from spreading when
hopping.[14] Rabbits do not have paw pads on their feet like most other animals that use digitigrade
locomotion. Instead, they have coarse compressed hair that offers protection.[15]
Musculature
Rabbits have muscled hind legs that allow for maximum force,
maneuverability, and acceleration that is divided into three main
parts; foot, thigh, and leg. The hind limbs of a rabbit are an
exaggerated feature. They are much longer than the forelimbs,
providing more force. Rabbits run on their toes to gain the optimal
stride during locomotion. The force put out by the hind limbs is
contributed to both the structural anatomy of the fusion tibia and
fibula, and muscular features.[16] Bone formation and removal, from
a cellular standpoint, is directly correlated to hind limb muscles.

rabbit's hind limbs can be classified into four main categories: hamstrings, quadriceps, dorsiflexors, or
plantar flexors. The quadriceps muscles are in charge of force production when jumping. Complementing
these muscles are the hamstrings, which aid in short bursts of action. These muscles play off of one another
in the same way as the plantar flexors and dorsiflexors, contributing to the generation and actions associated
with force.[18]

Ears
Within the order lagomorphs, the ears are utilized to detect and avoid
predators. In the family Leporidae, the ears are typically longer than
they are wide. For example, in black tailed jack rabbits, their long
ears cover a greater surface area relative to their body size that allow
them to detect predators from far away. Contrasted to cotton tailed
rabbits, their ears are smaller and shorter, requiring predators to be
closer to detect them before they can flee. Evolution has favored
rabbits having shorter ears so the larger surface area does not cause
them to lose heat in more temperate regions. The opposite can be
seen in rabbits that live in hotter climates, mainly because they
possess longer ears that have a larger surface area that help with
dispersion of heat as well as the theory that sound does not travel
well in more arid air, opposed to cooler air. Therefore, longer ears are
meant to aid the organism in detecting predators sooner rather than
later in warmer temperatures.[19] The rabbit is characterized by its
shorter ears while hares are characterized by their longer ears.[20]
Rabbits' ears are an important structure to aid thermoregulation and
detect predators due to how the outer, middle, and inner ear muscles
coordinate with one another. The ear muscles also aid in maintaining
balance and movement when fleeing predators.[21]

Outer ear
The auricle, also known as the pinna, is a rabbit's outer ear.[22] The
rabbit's pinnae represent a fair part of the body surface area. It is
theorized that the ears aid in dispersion of heat at temperatures above
30 °C with rabbits in warmer climates having longer pinnae due to
this. Another theory is that the ears function as shock absorbers that
could aid and stabilize rabbit's vision when fleeing predators, but this
has typically only been seen in hares.[23] The rest of the outer ear has
bent canals that lead to the eardrum or tympanic membrane.[24]

Anatomy of mammalian ear

Middle ear
The middle ear is filled with three bones called ossicles and is separated by the outer eardrum in the back of
the rabbit's skull. The three ossicles are called hammer, anvil, and stirrup and act to decrease sound before it
hits the inner ear. In general, the ossicles act as a barrier to the inner ear for sound energy.[24]
Inner ear
Inner ear fluid called endolymph receives the sound energy. After receiving the energy, later within the inner
ear there are two parts: the cochlea that utilizes sound waves from the ossicles and the vestibular apparatus
that manages the rabbit's position in regards to movement. Within the cochlea there is a basilar membrane
that contains sensory hair structures utilized to send nerve signals to the brain so it can recognize different
sound frequencies. Within the vestibular apparatus the rabbit possesses three semicircular canals to help
detect angular motion.[24]

Thermoregulation
Thermoregulation is the process that an organism utilizes to maintain an optimal body temperature
independent of external conditions.[25] This process is carried out by the pinnae, which takes up most of the
rabbit's body surface and contain a vascular network and arteriovenous shunts.[26] In a rabbit, the optimal
body temperature is around 38.5–40℃.[27] If their body temperature exceeds or does not meet this optimal
temperature, the rabbit must return to homeostasis. Homeostasis of body temperature is maintained by the
use of their large, highly vascularized ears that are able to change the amount of blood flow that passes
through the ears.
Constriction and dilation of blood vessels in the ears are used to
control the core body temperature of a rabbit. If the core temperature
exceeds its optimal temperature greatly, blood flow is constricted to
limit the amount of blood going through the vessels. With this
constriction, there is only a limited amount of blood that is passing
through the ears where ambient heat would be able to heat the blood
that is flowing through the ears and therefore, increasing the body
temperature. Constriction is also used when the ambient temperature
is much lower than that of the rabbit's core body temperature. When
the ears are constricted it again limits blood flow through the ears to
conserve the optimal body temperature of the rabbit. If the ambient
temperature is either 15 degrees above or below the optimal body
temperature, the blood vessels will dilate. With the blood vessels
being enlarged, the blood is able to pass through the large surface
area, causing it to either heat or cool down.

Rabbits use their large vascularized
ears, which aid in thermoregulation,
to keep their body temperature at an
optimal level.

During hot summers, the rabbit has the capability to stretch its pinnae, which allows for greater surface area
and increase heat dissipation. In cold winters, the rabbit does the opposite and folds its ears in order to
decrease its surface area to the ambient air, which would decrease their body temperature.
The jackrabbit has the largest ears within the Oryctolagus cuniculus
group. Their ears contribute to 17% of their total body surface area.
Their large pinna were evolved to maintain homeostasis while in the
extreme temperatures of the desert.

Respiratory system
The rabbit's nasal cavity lies dorsal to the oral cavity, and the two
compartments are separated by the hard and soft palate.[28] The nasal
cavity itself is separated into a left and right side by a cartilage
barrier, and it is covered in fine hairs that trap dust before it can enter
the respiratory tract.[28][29] As the rabbit breathes, air flows in
through the nostrils along the alar folds. From there, the air moves
into the nasal cavity, also known as the nasopharynx, down through
the trachea, through the larynx, and into the lungs.[29][30] The larynx

The trachea is a long tube embedded with
cartilaginous rings that prevent the tube from collapsing as air moves
in and out of the lungs. The trachea then splits into a left and right
bronchus, which meet the lungs at a structure called the hilum. From there, the bronchi split into
progressively more narrow and numerous branches. The bronchi branch into bronchioles, into respiratory

bronchioles, and ultimately terminate at the alveolar ducts. The branching that is typically found in rabbit
lungs is a clear example of monopodial branching, in which smaller branches divide out laterally from a
larger central branch.[31]
The structure of the rabbit's nasal and oral cavities, necessitates breathing through the nose. This is due to
the fact that the epiglottis is fixed to the backmost portion of the soft palate.[30] Within the oral cavity, a
layer of tissue sits over the opening of the glottis, which blocks airflow from the oral cavity to the
trachea.[28] The epiglottis functions to prevent the rabbit from aspirating on its food. Further, the presence of
a soft and hard palate allow the rabbit to breathe through its nose while it feeds.[29]
Rabbits lungs are divided into four lobes: the cranial, middle, caudal,
and accessory lobes. The right lung is made up of all four lobes,
while the left lung only has two: the cranial and caudal lobes.[31] In
order to provide space for the heart, the left cranial lobe of the lungs
is significantly smaller than that of the right.[28] The diaphragm is a
muscular structure that lies caudal to the lungs and contracts to
facilitate respiration.[28][30]

Digestion
Rabbits are herbivores that feed by grazing on grass and other leafy
plants. In consequence, their diet contains large amounts of cellulose,
which is hard to digest. Rabbits solve this problem via a form of
Monopodial branching as seen in
hindgut fermentation. They pass two distinct types of feces: hard
dissected rabbit lungs.
droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter of which are
known as caecotrophs or "night droppings" [32] and are immediately
eaten (a behaviour known as coprophagy). Rabbits reingest their own droppings (rather than chewing the
cud as do cows and numerous other herbivores) to digest their food further and extract sufficient
nutrients.[33]
Rabbits graze heavily and rapidly for roughly the first half-hour of a grazing period (usually in the late
afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding. In this time, the rabbit will also
excrete many hard fecal pellets, being waste pellets that will not be reingested. If the environment is
relatively non-threatening, the rabbit will remain outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals. While out of
the burrow, the rabbit will occasionally reingest its soft, partially digested pellets; this is rarely observed,
since the pellets are reingested as they are produced.
Hard pellets are made up of hay-like fragments of plant
cuticle and stalk, being the final waste product after
redigestion of soft pellets. These are only released
outside the burrow and are not reingested. Soft pellets
are usually produced several hours after grazing, after
the hard pellets have all been excreted. They are made
up of micro-organisms and undigested plant cell walls.
Rabbits are hindgut digesters. This means that most of
their digestion takes place in their large intestine and
cecum. In rabbits, the cecum is about 10 times bigger
than the stomach and it along with the large intestine
makes up roughly 40% of the rabbit's digestive tract.[34]

sometimes called "night feces", are high in minerals, vitamins and proteins that are necessary to the rabbit's
health. Rabbits eat these to meet their nutritional requirements; the mucous coating allows the nutrients to
pass through the acidic stomach for digestion in the intestines. This process allows rabbits to extract the
necessary nutrients from their food.[35]
The chewed plant material collects in the large cecum, a secondary chamber between the large and small
intestine containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of cellulose and also
produce certain B vitamins. The pellets are about 56% bacteria by dry weight, largely accounting for the
pellets being 24.4% protein on average. The soft feces form here and contain up to five times the vitamins of
hard feces. After being excreted, they are eaten whole by the rabbit and redigested in a special part of the
stomach. The pellets remain intact for up to six hours in the stomach; the bacteria within continue to digest
the plant carbohydrates. This double-digestion process enables rabbits to use nutrients that they may have
missed during the first passage through the gut, as well as the nutrients formed by the microbial activity and
thus ensures that maximum nutrition is derived from the food they eat.[11] This process serves the same
purpose in the rabbit as rumination does in cattle and sheep.[36]
Because rabbits cannot vomit,[37] if buildup occurs within the
intestines (due often to a diet with insufficient fibre),[38] intestinal
blockage can occur.[39]

Reproduction
The adult male reproductive system forms the same as most
mammals with the seminiferous tubular compartment containing the
Sertoli cells and an adluminal compartment that contains the Leydig
cells.[40] The Leydig cells produce testosterone, which maintains
libido[40] and creates secondary sex characteristics such as the genital
tubercle and penis. The Sertoli cells triggers the production of AntiMüllerian duct hormone, which absorbs the Müllerian duct. In an
adult male rabbit, the sheath of the penis is cylinder-like and can be
extruded as early as two months of age.[41] The scrotal sacs lay
lateral to the penis and contain epididymal fat pads which protect the
testes. Between 10 and 14 weeks, the testes descend and are able to
retract into the pelvic cavity in order to thermoregulate.[41]
Furthermore, the secondary sex characteristics, such as the testes, are
complex and secrete many compounds. These compounds includes
fructose, citric acid, minerals, and a uniquely high amount of
catalase.[40]

The adult female reproductive tract is bipartite, which prevents an
embryo from translocating between uteri.[42] The two uterine horns
communicate to two cervixes and forms one vaginal canal. Along
with being bipartite, the female rabbit does not go through an estrus
cycle, which causes mating induced ovulation.[41]

rabbit from behind and insert his penis into the female and make
rapid pelvic hip thrusts. The encounter lasts only 20–40 seconds and after, the male will throw himself
backwards off the female.[43]

The rabbit gestation period is short and ranges from 28 to 36 days
with an average period of 31 days. A longer gestation period will
generally yield a smaller litter while shorter gestation periods will
give birth to a larger litter. The size of a single litter can range from
four to 12 kits allowing a female to deliver up to 60 new kits a year.
After birth, the female can become pregnant again as early as the
next day.[41]
The mortality rates of embryos are high in rabbits and can be due to
infection, trauma, poor nutrition and environmental stress so a high
fertility rate is necessary to counter this.[41]

Sleep
Rabbits may appear to be crepuscular, but their natural inclination is toward nocturnal activity.[44] In 2011,
the average sleep time of a rabbit in captivity was calculated at 8.4 hours per day.[45] As with other prey
animals, rabbits often sleep with their eyes open, so that sudden movements will awaken the rabbit to
respond to potential danger.[46]

Diseases and immunity
In addition to being at risk of disease from common pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and
Escherichia coli, rabbits can contract the virulent, species-specific viruses RHD ("rabbit hemorrhagic
disease", a form of calicivirus)[47] or myxomatosis. Among the parasites that infect rabbits are tapeworms
(such as Taenia serialis), external parasites (including fleas and mites), coccidia species, and Toxoplasma
gondii.[48][49] Domesticated rabbits with a diet lacking in high fiber sources, such as hay and grass, are
susceptible to potentially lethal gastrointestinal stasis.[50] Rabbits and hares are almost never found to be
infected with rabies and have not been known to transmit rabies to humans.[51]
Encephalitozoon cuniculi, an obligate intracellular parasite is also capable of infecting many mammals
including rabbits.
Rabbit immunity has significantly diverged from other tetrapods in the manner it employs immunoglobulin
light chains.[52][53][54][55][56] In one case McCartney-Francis et al., 1984 discover a unique additional
disulfide bond between Cys 80 in Vκ and Cys 171 in Cκ.[52][53][54][55][56] They suggest that this may serve
to stabilise rabbit antibodies.[52][53][54][55][56] Meanwhile IGKC1 shows high amino acid divergence
between domesticated types and ferals derived from them.[53] This can be as high as 40%.[53]

Ecology
Rabbits are prey animals and are therefore constantly aware of their surroundings. For instance, in
Mediterranean Europe, rabbits are the main prey of red foxes, badgers, and Iberian lynxes.[57] If confronted
by a potential threat, a rabbit may freeze and observe then warn others in the warren with powerful thumps
on the ground. Rabbits have a remarkably wide field of vision, and a good deal of it is devoted to overhead
scanning.[58] They survive predation by burrowing, hopping away in a zig-zag motion, and, if captured,
delivering powerful kicks with their hind legs. Their strong teeth allow them to eat and to bite in order to
escape a struggle.[59] The longest-lived rabbit on record, a domesticated European rabbit living in Tasmania,
died at age 18.[60] The lifespan of wild rabbits is much shorter; the average longevity of an eastern
cottontail, for instance, is less than one year.[61]

Habitat and range
Rabbit habitats include meadows, woods, forests, grasslands,
deserts and wetlands.[62] Rabbits live in groups, and the best
known species, the European rabbit, lives in burrows, or
rabbit holes. A group of burrows is called a warren.[62]
More than half the world's rabbit population resides in North
America.[62] They are also native to southwestern Europe,
Southeast Asia, Sumatra, some islands of Japan, and in parts
Rabbit kits one hour after birth
of Africa and South America. They are not naturally found in
most of Eurasia, where a number of species of hares are
present. Rabbits first entered South America relatively
recently, as part of the Great American Interchange. Much of the continent has just one species of rabbit, the
tapeti, while most of South America's southern cone is without rabbits.
The European rabbit has been introduced to many places around the world.[11]
Rabbits have been launched into space orbit.[63]

Environmental problems
Rabbits have been a source of environmental problems when
introduced into the wild by humans. As a result of their appetites, and
the rate at which they breed, feral rabbit depredation can be
problematic for agriculture. Gassing (fumigation of warrens),[64]
barriers (fences), shooting, snaring, and ferreting have been used to
control rabbit populations, but the most effective measures are
diseases such as myxomatosis (myxo or mixi, colloquially) and
calicivirus. In Europe, where rabbits are farmed on a large scale, they
are protected against myxomatosis and calicivirus with a genetically
modified virus. The virus was developed in Spain, and is beneficial
to rabbit farmers. If it were to make its way into wild populations in
areas such as Australia, it could create a population boom, as those
diseases are the most serious threats to rabbit survival. Rabbits in
Australia and New Zealand are considered to be such a pest that land
owners are legally obliged to control them.[65][66]

In some areas, wild rabbits and hares are hunted for their meat, a lean
source of high quality protein.[67] In the wild, such hunting is accomplished with the aid of trained falcons,
ferrets, or dogs, as well as with snares or other traps, and rifles. A caught rabbit may be dispatched with a
sharp blow to the back of its head, a practice from which the term rabbit punch is derived.
Wild leporids comprise a small portion of global rabbit-meat consumption. Domesticated descendants of the
European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) that are bred and kept as livestock (a practice called cuniculture)
account for the estimated 200 million tons of rabbit meat produced annually.[68] Approximately 1.2 billion
rabbits are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide.[69] In 1994, the countries with the highest
consumption per capita of rabbit meat were Malta with 8.89 kg (19 lb 10 oz), Italy with 5.71 kg (12 lb 9 oz),
and Cyprus with 4.37 kg (9 lb 10 oz), falling to 0.03 kg (1 oz) in Japan. The figure for the United States was
0.14 kg (5 oz) per capita. The largest producers of rabbit meat in 1994 were China, Russia, Italy, France, and

feral rabbits in the area.
In the United Kingdom, fresh rabbit is sold in
butcher shops and markets, and some
supermarkets sell frozen rabbit meat. At farmers
Taddeo Crivelli (Italian, died about 1479)
markets there, including the famous Borough
Market in London, rabbit carcasses are
sometimes displayed hanging, unbutchered (in the traditional style), next to braces of pheasant or other
small game. Rabbit meat is a feature of Moroccan cuisine, where it is cooked in a tajine with "raisins and
grilled almonds added a few minutes before serving".[71] In China, rabbit meat is particularly popular in
Sichuan cuisine, with its stewed rabbit, spicy diced rabbit, BBQ-style rabbit, and even spicy rabbit heads,
which have been compared to spicy duck neck.[68] Rabbit meat is comparatively unpopular elsewhere in the
Asia-Pacific.

An extremely rare infection associated with rabbits-as-food is tularemia (also known as rabbit fever), which
may be contracted from an infected rabbit.[72] Hunters are at higher risk for tularemia because of the
potential for inhaling the bacteria during the skinning process.
In addition to their meat, rabbits are used for their wool, fur, and pelts, as well as their nitrogen-rich manure
and their high-protein milk.[73] Production industries have developed domesticated rabbit breeds (such as
the well-known Angora rabbit) to efficiently fill these needs.

In art, literature, and culture
Rabbits are often used as a symbol of fertility or rebirth, and have long been associated with spring and
Easter as the Easter Bunny. The species' role as a prey animal with few defenses evokes vulnerability and
innocence, and in folklore and modern children's stories, rabbits often appear as sympathetic characters, able
to connect easily with youth of all kinds (for example, the Velveteen Rabbit, or Thumper in Bambi).

With its reputation as a prolific breeder, the rabbit juxtaposes sexuality with innocence, as in the Playboy
Bunny. The rabbit (as a swift prey animal) is also known for its speed, agility, and endurance, symbolized
(for example) by the marketing icons the Energizer Bunny and the Duracell Bunny.

Folklore
The rabbit often appears in folklore as the trickster archetype, as he uses his cunning to outwit his enemies.
In Aztec mythology, a
pantheon of four
hundred rabbit gods
known as Centzon
Totochtin, led by
Ometochtli or Two
Rabbit, represented
fertility, parties, and
drunkenness.
In Central Africa, the
"Three rabbits" motif
common hare
Coat of arms of Corbenay,
(Kalulu), is "inevitably

described" as a
trickster figure.[74]

Chang'e on the Moon. In the Chinese New
Illustration (from 1354) of the Panchatantra
Year, the zodiacal rabbit is one of the twelve
celestial animals in the Chinese zodiac. Note
that the Vietnamese zodiac includes a zodiacal cat in place of the rabbit, possibly because
rabbits did not inhabit Vietnam. The most common explanation, however, is that the ancient
Vietnamese word for "rabbit" (mao) sounds like the Chinese word for "cat" (卯, mao).[75]
In Japanese tradition, rabbits live on the Moon where they make mochi, the popular snack of
mashed sticky rice. This comes from interpreting the pattern of dark patches on the moon as a
rabbit standing on tiptoes on the left pounding on an usu, a Japanese mortar.
In Jewish folklore, rabbits (shfanim ‫ )שפנים‬are associated with cowardice, a usage still current
in contemporary Israeli spoken Hebrew (similar to the English colloquial use of "chicken" to
denote cowardice).
In Korean mythology, as in Japanese, rabbits live on the moon making rice cakes ("Tteok" in
Korean).
In Anishinaabe traditional beliefs, held by the Ojibwe and some other Native American
peoples, Nanabozho, or Great Rabbit, is an important deity related to the creation of the world.
A Vietnamese mythological story portrays the rabbit of innocence and youthfulness. The Gods
of the myth are shown to be hunting and killing rabbits to show off their power.
Buddhism, Christianity, and Judaism have associations with an ancient circular motif called the
three rabbits (or "three hares"). Its meaning ranges from "peace and tranquility", to purity or the
Holy Trinity, to Kabbalistic levels of the soul or to the Jewish diaspora. The tripartite symbol
also appears in heraldry and even tattoos.
The rabbit as trickster is a part of American popular culture, as Br'er Rabbit (from African-American
folktales and, later, Disney animation) and Bugs Bunny (the cartoon character from Warner Bros.), for
example.
Anthropomorphized rabbits have appeared in film and literature, in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (the
White Rabbit and the March Hare characters), in Watership Down (including the film and television
adaptations), in Rabbit Hill (by Robert Lawson), and in the Peter Rabbit stories (by Beatrix Potter). In the
1920s, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, was a popular cartoon character.

A rabbit's foot may be
carried as an amulet,
believed
to
bring
protection and good luck.
This belief is found in
many parts of the world,
with the earliest use being
recorded in Europe c.
600 BC.[76]
On the Isle of Portland in
Dorset, UK, the rabbit is
said to be unlucky and
even
speaking
the
creature's name can cause
Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit.
WWII USAF pilot D. R. Emerson
upset among older island
"flys with a rabbit's foot talisman,
residents. This is thought
a gift from a New York girl friend"
to date back to early times
in the local quarrying industry where (to save space) extracted
stones that were not fit for sale were set aside in what became tall,
unstable walls. The local rabbits' tendency to burrow there would weaken the walls and their collapse
resulted in injuries or even death. Thus, invoking the name of the culprit became an unlucky act to be
avoided. In the local culture to this day, the rabbit (when he has to be referred to) may instead be called a
“long ears” or “underground mutton”, so as not to risk bringing a downfall upon oneself. While it was true
50 years ago that a pub on the island could be emptied by calling out the word "rabbit", this has become
more fable than fact in modern times.
In other parts of Britain and in North America, invoking the rabbit's name may instead bring good luck.
"Rabbit rabbit rabbit" is one variant of an apotropaic or talismanic superstition that involves saying or
repeating the word "rabbit" (or "rabbits" or "white rabbits" or some combination thereof) out loud upon
waking on the first day of each month, because doing so will ensure good fortune for the duration of that
month.
The "rabbit test" is a term, first used in 1949, for the Friedman test, an early diagnostic tool for detecting a
pregnancy in humans. It is a common misconception (or perhaps an urban legend) that the test-rabbit would
die if the woman was pregnant. This led to the phrase "the rabbit died" becoming a euphemism for a positive
pregnancy test.
